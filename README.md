Prediction using the decision tree algorithm involves constructing a tree-like model based on features of a dataset to make predictions. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a feature, leading to subsequent branches and leaf nodes representing outcomes or predictions. This simple yet powerful algorithm is widely used in classification and regression tasks due to its interpretability and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data efficiently.
